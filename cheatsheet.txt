Arrays:

- reference item inside array:      ${ArrayName[x]}, example: ${options[2]}
- length of an array:               ${#ArrayName[@]}, example: ${#options[@]}
- pass array to function            functionName "${ArrayName[@]}, example: checkWidth "${options[@]}"
- read array argument in function   var=("$@"), example: options=("$@")                                 NOTE: Works when array is the only argument; for others, use next example
- read array argument in function   var=("${@:x}"), example: arguments: (var, var2, array), arr=("${@:3}")

Operator	            Description
! EXPRESSION	        The EXPRESSION is false.
-n STRING	            The length of STRING is greater than zero.
-z STRING	            The lengh of STRING is zero (ie it is empty).
STRING1 = STRING2	    STRING1 is equal to STRING2
STRING1 != STRING2	    STRING1 is not equal to STRING2
INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2	INTEGER1 is numerically equal to INTEGER2
INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2	INTEGER1 is numerically greater than INTEGER2
INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2	INTEGER1 is numerically less than INTEGER2
-d FILE	                FILE exists and is a directory.
-e FILE	                FILE exists.
-r FILE	                FILE exists and the read permission is granted.
-s FILE	                FILE exists and it's size is greater than zero (ie. it is not empty).
-w FILE	                FILE exists and the write permission is granted.
-x FILE	                FILE exists and the execute permission is granted.
