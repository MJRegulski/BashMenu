# BashMenu
Set of functions used to generate interactive menu in shell

# Description
Hi! :wave:

Welcome to my little project on interactive bash menu!

Project consists of multiple files used to:
- read xml file and extract main attributes and values
- generate menu with a border given title and list of options
- save menu to a text file
- read text file menu and highlight current option
- call back source xml file to check for action on specific user selection

# Use

Repository is currently a holder for a specific tool, but once first official version is complete,
this repository will be transformed into set of reusable functions for others to use.

In the meantime I encourage you to preview the code and use bits of it if you find it useful :wink:
